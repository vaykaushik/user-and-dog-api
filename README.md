**What was the goal of this project?**

1 - To understand the basics of 'useState' and how it can be used to display relevant data pulled from an API.

2 - How to use Axios to make a successful 'GET' request from a specifc endpoint.

**What do I want to understand next?**

1 - How to use 'useEffect' in combination with 'useState' to dyanamically display a query based on what the user has typed.

**What were the challenges of this project?**

1 - Becoming familiar with Axios and transferring my knowledge syntactically from Javascript into React by using hooks for the first time.

2 - Reading and interpreting the documentation for The Dog API specifically. I wanted to display relevant information based on what the user has typed, but there were no successful examples given of how to do so with a correct API call. I will therefore have to look at another API in order to do this.
